# Ant Simulator

https://otcova.github.io/ant-simulator

Ants will spawn from home at the beginning of the simulation 
and when they go far from home.
We can interact with them by clicking,
which will spawn some food for the ants to pick.
The ants only communicate by dropping two types of pheromones on the ground.
It's amazing to see these beautiful behaviours emerge from such a simple concept.
